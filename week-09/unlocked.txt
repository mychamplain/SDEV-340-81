Greetings Chris, my wife and I have eight children, we are living in Namibia Windhoek with many pets in a ten bedroom house. I started at the hardware side, building computers and fixing sound systems and many other electronic systems. Then around 2006 the need to build websites and understand software began. I am now the owner of Vast Development Method an Namibia software development firm, and server as a full time minister of the Gospel at https://TrueChristian.Church As a hobby I have been doing carpentry.
